# What is Django?
# Django is a web framework which helps you build interactive websites using Python.
# With Django you define the kind of data your site needs to work with, and you define
# the ways your users can work with that data.

# Installing Django
# It's usually best to install Django to a virtual environment, where your project
# can be isolated from your other Python projects.
